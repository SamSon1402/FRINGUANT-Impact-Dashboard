This interactive dashboard shows how our selfie-based size recommendation system improves key business metrics in real-time.

- **Higher Customer Satisfaction**: Visualize improvement in customer satisfaction scores (average 9.2/10) when shoppers find their perfect fit

## How It Works

The FRINGUANT Impact Dashboard analyzes real-time data from your e-commerce platform to:

1. **Capture data** from two customer groups: those using size recommendations and those not
2. **Compare metrics** between these groups to quantify the impact
3. **Visualize results** in easy-to-understand charts and graphs
4. **Project ROI** using your actual business data
5. **Track improvements** over time as more customers use the technology

All data is automatically processed and refreshed, giving you always up-to-date insights into how size recommendations affect your business.
